Raviv was known as an openly violent critic of the Prime Minister's role in the Oslo Accords and the peace process. There is speculation that Yamir was working under the auspices of Eyal, but only his association with the group were confirmed.  There are also allegations that Rabin's aides were informed in June that there would be an assassination, and were informed of many characteristics of the perpetrator.  Little is known as to whether or not Shin Bet actually received this information.  Hagai Amir, the assailants brother, and Dror Adani were also charged with involvement in the murder.","Rabin Assassinated at Peace Rally.
